* Description :unfold:
This module can redisplay ASCII/GitHub emoticon strings as corresponding Unicode
emoji. In addition, a completion command is provided to insert these strings as
well as the typical Unicode representations.

Note: Emacs 29 provides [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-29.1#n884][native support]] for inserting Unicode emojis. This module
only remains useful if you want ASCII/GitHub emoticon string
insertion/conversion or need PNG/ASCII emoji rendering on a system with limited
font configuration.

From the [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/blob/master/README.org#requirements][emojify requirements]] docs:
#+begin_quote
The [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][emojify]] package requires Emacs *v24.3* and above. Emacs should be compiled
with support for *PNG* images to display emojis as images. It is *recommended*
that Emacs is compiled with *ImageMagick* support. ~emojify~ will use it to
resize emojis if needed, additionally imagemagick is used to set background
color for emojis to workaround the bug described in [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/issues/7][issue 7]]. However these are
*completely optional*.

PNG support might require some additional steps to on Windows, you might find
